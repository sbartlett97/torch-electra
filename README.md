# ELECTRA Training Implementation

This repository contains a custom implementation of the ELECTRA training method using PyTorch and HuggingFace's Transformers library. ELECTRA (Efficiently Learning an Encoder that Classifies Token Replacements Accurately) is a transformer-based model pre-trained as a discriminator rather than a generator, resulting in a more compute-efficient pre-training approach.

## Features

- **Custom Implementation**: Implements the ELECTRA training method with flexibility for further experimentation and research.
- **PyTorch and HuggingFace Integration**: Leverages PyTorch's efficiency and HuggingFace's comprehensive Transformer library for model loading and tokenization.
- **Configurable Pipeline**: Supports hyperparameter tuning, dynamic masking, and fine-grained model customization.
- **Efficient Training**: Implements key ELECTRA techniques for efficient training, such as replaced token detection and gradient accumulation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- PyTorch 1.10 or later
- HuggingFace Transformers 4.30 or later

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. **Prepare Data**: Preprocess your dataset into the appropriate format using HuggingFace's `datasets` library.
2. **Train**: Use the provided training script to begin training an ELECTRA model from scratch or fine-tune a pre-trained model.
   ```bash
   python train.py --config config.yaml
   ```
3. **Evaluate**: Run the evaluation script to test the performance of the trained model.
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model_path ./output/model
   ```

### Configuration

Modify the `config.yaml` file to set hyperparameters, data paths, and model configurations. Key parameters include:

- **`generator_model`**: Pre-trained generator model (e.g., `bert-base-uncased`).
- **`discriminator_model`**: Pre-trained discriminator model.
- **`learning_rate`**: Learning rate for optimization.
- **`num_training_steps`**: Total number of training steps.
